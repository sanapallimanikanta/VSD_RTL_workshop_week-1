This workshop is for anyone interested in **Verilog RTL design** and synthesis 💻. It's a hands-on learning series that uses open-source tools to teach fundamental and advanced digital circuit design.

***

# **Workshop Overview**

You'll learn to use tools like **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave** for simulation and waveform analysis, and **Yosys** with the **SKY130 open-source PDK** for logic synthesis. The curriculum covers key concepts like:

* Verilog RTL design and simulation 📝
* Writing testbenches 🧪
* Understanding timing libraries and synthesis flows ⏰
* Coding efficient D flip-flops 💾
* Digital optimization techniques 🚀

***

### **Prerequisites**

To get started, you should have:

* A basic understanding of digital logic (gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, etc.) 🧠
* Familiarity with Linux shell commands 🐧
* Access to a Linux environment (or WSL) 🖥️
* The necessary tools installed: `git`, `iverilog`, `gtkwave`, `yosys`, and a text editor.

***

### **Workshop Structure**

The workshop is divided into five days, with each day focusing on a specific topic:

* **Day 1**: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis.
* **Day 2**: Timing Libraries, Synthesis Approaches, and Efficient Flip-Flop Coding.
* **Day 3**: Combinational and Sequential Optimization.
* **Day 4**: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS), Blocking vs. Non-Blocking, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch.
* **Day 5**: Optimization in Synthesis.

Each day's content includes clear explanations, step-by-step labs, and best practices. ✅
